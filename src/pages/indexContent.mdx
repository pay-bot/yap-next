# Rich Text Editor
___

This is a rich text editor I created. It is built on the [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org) framework for React. The Github repo for this demo is [here](https://github.com/EvanMorrison/draft-js-rte). You can see other examples of my work at [evmorrison.com](https://evmorrison.com).

Notable features include:
- support for tables
- insert and resize images
- insert and edit links
